# MOTION-SENSE-AUTOMATED-VEHICLE-PARKING
This project implements an automated car parking system using an Arduino, servo motor, and sensors to manage vehicle entry and exit. The system keeps track of the number of cars in the parking lot, ensures the parking lot does not exceed its maximum capacity, and controls the gate using a servo motor.
